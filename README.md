# Harsh Dudhat — Developer Portfolio

Welcome! This is my personal portfolio site showcasing my projects, technical skills, certifications, and career journey in web development.

## ✨ About the Project

This portfolio was built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS** — modern web technologies known for performance and developer experience.  
While I primarily work with .NET, AngularJS, and SQL in my day-to-day roles, I created this portfolio with the help of **AI tools and documentation** to explore and adapt to new technologies, reflecting my ability to learn quickly and work across different stacks when needed.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Project Portfolio** — Highlighting real-world applications I've worked on.
- **Skills Visualization** — Displaying my core technical competencies.
- **Contact Form** — Allowing direct communication.
- **AI-Powered Cover Letter Generator** — Experimental tool that uses AI to craft tailored cover letters based on job descriptions and my background.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js (React + TypeScript)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **UI/UX**: Clean grid layout, iconography, and subtle animations
- **Extras**: Markdown-based content management and LLM-powered features

## 📌 Purpose

This project is both a **professional showcase** and a **personal learning exercise** — bridging my core .NET development experience with modern front-end tools. It represents my passion for continuous learning and adaptability in the fast-evolving tech landscape.
