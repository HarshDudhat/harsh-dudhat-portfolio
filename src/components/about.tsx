              About Me
            </h2>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-base md:text-lg">
              I&apos;m a full-stack developer with a strong foundation in the
              Microsoft ecosystem — but beyond the tools, I care about writing
              thoughtful, maintainable code that solves real-world problems.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-base md:text-lg">
              Over the years, I’ve worked on everything from EHS platforms to
              finance applications, always aiming to build systems that are not
              just functional but also intuitive and future-proof.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-base md:text-lg">
              When I&apos;m not coding, you&apos;ll probably find me watching
              cricket highlights, reading fantasy novels, or tinkering with side
              projects to try out the latest web tech.
            </p>

              I created this portfolio without any prior experience in
              technologies like Next.js or Tailwind CSS. I used AI tools to
              guide me through each step, from setting up the project to
              refining UI components. What started as a blank screen turned into
              a hands-on learning experience where I built, broke, and rebuilt
              things until they worked.
            </p>
            <p className="text-muted-foreground text-base md:text-lg">
              This project isn’t just a portfolio — it’s proof that with
              curiosity, persistence, and the right tools, you can learn
              anything you set your mind to.
